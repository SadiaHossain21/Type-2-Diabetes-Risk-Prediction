# Type 2 Diabetes Risk Prediction 

This project aims to predict whether an individual is at risk of developing **Type 2 Diabetes** based on clinical features using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The dataset includes features such as:
- Glucose
- BMI
- Age
- Pregnancies
- Insulin levels
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values and anomalies
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Distribution plots and correlation analysis
   - Feature skewness and log transformations
3. **Feature Engineering & Scaling**
4. **Model Building**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Trees / Random Forest
5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC AUC

## Key Findings

- Glucose and BMI are the strongest predictors.
- Feature normalization improves model performance.
- Ensemble models yield higher predictive accuracy.

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How to Run
Please follow the steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the folder where your .ipynb file is located.

3. Run "jupyter notebook type-2-diabetes-risk-prediction.ipynb."

This will launch the notebook in a web browser so that you can explore, run, or edit it interactively.
